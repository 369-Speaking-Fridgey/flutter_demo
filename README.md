# flutter_demo
temporary flutter app with flask as server (will be deprecated soon)
### To Test the Flutter image utils <=> Flask server, there are many prerquisits

1. Open a tunnel using ngrok to allow the local host be available anywhere.
  `ngrok http 127.0.0.1:5000`
 
2. Open two terminals, and from the `testapp` folder, run `flask run` & from the `study_v1/study_v1` folder, run `flutter run`.

3. If an android device is connected, you can test the buttons. The Result Looks like below.
